# Raise a virtual hand on custom Daily-co video chats 
This repository should help get you test out a custom[Daily.co](https://www.daily.co/) video chat embedded in a website, complete with a Raise Your Hand feature.

Test out an already running demo at: [https://daily-chat-raise-your-hand.netlify.app/](https://daily-chat-raise-your-hand.netlify.app/).

If you're looking for more complete step-by-step instructions, you can find them [here in the repository](https://github.com/kimberleejohnson/custom-video-chat/blob/master/step-by-step.md), and also on [the blog]().  

## Setting up the project
1. If you don't have one yet, you'll need to [sign up for a Daily.co account](https://dashboard.daily.co/).
2. Fork and clone this repository. 
3. From your terminal, `cd custom-video-chat`. 
4. Again from the command line, `npm i`. 
5. `npm run dev` 

With that, you should be up and running! Enjoy playing around with the [Daily.co API](https://docs.daily.co/reference) (the `.addFakeParticipant()` method is my favorite).
